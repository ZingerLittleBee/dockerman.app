## Overview

The Images page lets you manage all Docker images on your system, including pulling new images, building from Dockerfiles, and cleaning up unused ones.

## Image List

All local images are displayed with:

- Repository and tag
- Image ID
- Size
- Created time

## Pulling an Image

1. Click **Pull** on the Images page
2. Enter the image name and tag (e.g., `nginx:latest`)
3. Click **Pull** to start downloading

The pull progress is displayed in real time with layer-by-layer download status.

## Building an Image

1. Click **Build** on the Images page
2. Select a Dockerfile or build context directory
3. Set the image tag
4. Click **Build** to start

Build output is streamed in real time so you can monitor each build step.

## Managing Images

- **Remove** — Delete an image (will fail if containers depend on it)
- **Tag** — Add a new tag to an existing image
- **History** — View the layer history of an image
- **Inspect** — View detailed image metadata in JSON format

## Cleaning Up

Use the **Prune** button to remove all dangling (untagged) images and reclaim disk space.
