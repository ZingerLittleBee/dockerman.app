## Overview

Dockerman's file browser lets you explore the filesystem inside a running container. You can navigate directories, view files, and transfer files between your host and the container.

## Browsing Files

1. Navigate to a running container
2. Click the **Files** tab
3. The file browser shows the container's root filesystem

Navigate directories by clicking on them. The breadcrumb trail shows your current path.

## Viewing Files

Click on a file to view its contents. Dockerman supports previewing:

- Text files (logs, configs, scripts)
- JSON and YAML files with syntax highlighting

## Uploading Files

1. Navigate to the target directory in the container
2. Click **Upload**
3. Select files from your host machine
4. Files are copied into the container at the current path

## Downloading Files

Right-click a file or directory and select **Download** to save it to your host machine. Directories are downloaded as tar archives.
