## Docker Connection Issues

### Dockerman cannot connect to Docker

1. Verify Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```
2. Check the Docker socket exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
   ```
3. Ensure your user has permission to access Docker:
   ```bash
   groups | grep docker
   ```

### Connection timeout

- Increase the timeout in **Settings > Docker Connection**
- Restart the Docker daemon and try again

## Performance Issues

### Dockerman is slow or unresponsive

- Close unused terminal sessions
- Reduce the number of containers displayed (use filters)
- Check system resource usage — Dockerman is lightweight but Docker itself may consume resources

### High memory usage

- Large log buffers can consume memory. Clear container logs or reduce log retention in Settings
- Close file browser tabs you're not using

## Display Issues

### UI appears broken or unstyled

- Update Dockerman to the latest version
- Clear the application cache in **Settings > Data > Clear Cache**
- Restart the application

### Dark mode not working

- Ensure your system theme is set correctly
- Try switching to an explicit theme (Light or Dark) in Settings instead of System

## Platform-Specific Issues

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened"

This happens when macOS blocks unsigned applications:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Dockerman.app
```

### Linux: Application won't launch

Ensure required system libraries are installed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-0 libgtk-3-0
```

### Windows: WSL connection issues

See the [WSL guide](/docs/platform/wsl) for detailed troubleshooting.
