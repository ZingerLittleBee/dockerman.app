## License FAQ

**Can I use one license on multiple machines?**
Each license is valid for one machine at a time. Deactivate on one machine before activating on another.

Dockerman reverts to the Free tier. Your data and settings are preserved.

**How do I get a refund?**
Contact support within 14 days of purchase for a full refund.
