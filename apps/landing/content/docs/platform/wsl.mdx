title: Windows WSL
description: Using Dockerman with Windows Subsystem for Linux
---

## Overview

Dockerman supports Docker running through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2). This guide covers setup and common configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 2004+ or Windows 11
- WSL 2 enabled
- Docker Desktop installed with WSL 2 backend, or Docker Engine running directly in WSL 2

## Setup with Docker Desktop

If you use Docker Desktop with WSL 2 backend:

1. Open Docker Desktop settings
2. Go to **Resources > WSL Integration**
3. Enable integration for your preferred WSL distro
4. Install and launch Dockerman on Windows
5. Dockerman connects to Docker automatically

## Setup with Docker Engine in WSL 2

If you run Docker Engine directly inside WSL 2 (without Docker Desktop):

1. Start Docker Engine in your WSL 2 distro
2. Ensure the Docker socket is accessible at `/var/run/docker.sock`
3. Launch Dockerman — it will detect the Docker socket

## Common Issues

### Docker socket not found

Make sure Docker is running in your WSL 2 distro:

```bash
sudo service docker start
```

### Slow performance

WSL 2 uses a virtual machine. For best performance:

- Store your project files inside the WSL 2 filesystem (not on Windows drives)
- Allocate sufficient memory to WSL 2 in `.wslconfig`

### Connection refused

Verify Docker is accessible:

```bash
docker info
```

If this fails, restart the Docker service or check your WSL 2 configuration.
