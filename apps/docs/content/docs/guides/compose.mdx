## Overview

Dockerman supports Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. You can import Compose files, start and stop services, and view logs for each service.

## Importing a Compose Project

1. Click **Import** on the Compose page
2. Select a `docker-compose.yml` file or a directory containing one
3. Dockerman will parse the file and display all defined services

## Managing Services

Each Compose project shows its services with their current status. You can:

- **Start All** — Launch all services in the project
- **Stop All** — Stop all running services
- **Start / Stop** individual services
- **Restart** a specific service

## Viewing Logs

Select a service to view its logs. You can:

- Stream logs in real time
- Filter by service name
- Search within log output

## Environment Variables

Compose projects can use `.env` files. Dockerman reads these automatically from the project directory.

## Removing a Project

Click **Remove** to tear down all containers, networks, and volumes created by the Compose project.
