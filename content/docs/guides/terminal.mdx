title: Built-in Terminal
description: Access container shells directly from Dockerman
---

## Overview

Dockerman includes a built-in terminal that lets you open a shell inside any running container without leaving the application.

## Opening a Terminal

1. Navigate to a running container
2. Click the **Terminal** tab or button
3. A terminal session opens inside the container

## Shell Selection

Dockerman tries to detect available shells in the container:

- `/bin/bash` — Used by default if available
- `/bin/sh` — Fallback for minimal containers

You can also specify a custom shell command when opening a terminal.

## Terminal Features

- Full interactive terminal with keyboard input
- Copy and paste support
- Scrollback buffer for reviewing output
- Multiple terminal sessions to the same container

## Closing a Terminal

Close the terminal tab to end the session. The terminal process inside the container is terminated when you disconnect.
