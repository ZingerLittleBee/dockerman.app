## Overview

Dockerman provides a visual interface for managing your Docker containers. You can view, create, start, stop, restart, and remove containers from a single dashboard.

## Container List

The main Containers page displays all containers on your system, including running and stopped ones. Each entry shows:

- Container name and ID
- Image used
- Current status (running, stopped, paused)
- Port mappings
- Created time

Use the search bar to filter containers by name or image.

## Creating a Container

1. Click the **Create** button on the Containers page
2. Select a base image from your local images or pull a new one
3. Configure container settings:
   - Name
   - Port mappings
   - Volume mounts
   - Environment variables
   - Resource limits (CPU, memory)
4. Click **Create** to launch the container

## Container Actions

Right-click a container or use the action buttons to:

- **Start** — Start a stopped container
- **Stop** — Gracefully stop a running container
- **Restart** — Stop and start the container
- **Pause / Unpause** — Freeze or resume container processes
- **Remove** — Delete the container (must be stopped first)

## Viewing Logs

Click on a container to open its detail view, then select the **Logs** tab. Features include:

- Real-time log streaming
- Timestamp display
- Search and filter within logs
- Download logs as a file

## Inspecting a Container

The **Inspect** tab shows detailed container configuration in JSON format, including network settings, mounts, and environment variables.
