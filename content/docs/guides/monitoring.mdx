description: Monitor container resource usage in real time
---

## Overview

Dockerman provides real-time monitoring of container resource usage. Track CPU, memory, network I/O, and disk I/O for running containers.

## Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard shows an overview of your Docker environment:

- Total containers (running / stopped)
- System CPU and memory usage
- Network throughput

## Container Stats

Click on a running container to view real-time stats:

- **CPU** — Usage percentage with a live graph
- **Memory** — Current usage, limit, and percentage
- **Network I/O** — Bytes sent and received per second
- **Disk I/O** — Read and write operations per second

Stats update automatically every few seconds.

## Resource Alerts

Dockerman highlights containers that are approaching their resource limits:

- High CPU usage is shown in yellow/red
- Memory usage near the limit triggers a warning

## Monitoring Tips

- Use resource limits when creating containers to prevent runaway usage
- Check the monitoring dashboard regularly for performance issues
- Container stats are only available for running containers
