## Overview

Dockerman provides a visual interface for managing Docker networks. You can view existing networks, create new ones, and connect or disconnect containers.

## Network List

The Networks page shows all Docker networks with:

- Network name and ID
- Driver type (bridge, host, overlay, etc.)
- Scope (local, swarm)
- Connected container count

## Creating a Network

1. Click **Create** on the Networks page
2. Configure:
   - Network name
   - Driver (bridge is the most common)
   - Subnet and gateway (optional)
   - Enable IPv6 (optional)
3. Click **Create**

## Connecting Containers

1. Click on a network to view its details
2. Use the **Connect** button to add a container to the network
3. Use the **Disconnect** button to remove a container

## Inspecting a Network

The detail view shows the full network configuration including:

- IPAM settings
- Connected containers with their IP addresses
- Network options and labels

## Removing a Network

Click **Remove** on a network to delete it. The network must have no connected containers before it can be removed.
