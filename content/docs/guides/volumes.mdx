description: Create and manage Docker volumes for persistent data
---

## Overview

Docker volumes provide persistent storage for container data. Dockerman lets you create, inspect, and manage volumes from a visual interface.

## Volume List

The Volumes page displays all Docker volumes with:

- Volume name
- Driver
- Mount point
- Created time

## Creating a Volume

1. Click **Create** on the Volumes page
2. Enter a volume name
3. Select a driver (local is the default)
4. Add labels if needed
5. Click **Create**

## Using Volumes

Volumes can be mounted when creating a container:

1. In the container creation form, go to the **Volumes** section
2. Click **Add Mount**
3. Select the volume and set the mount path inside the container
4. Choose read-write or read-only access

## Inspecting a Volume

Click on a volume to view:

- Full configuration in JSON format
- Mount point on the host
- Labels and options
- Containers currently using this volume

## Removing a Volume

Click **Remove** to delete a volume. The volume must not be in use by any container.

Use **Prune** to remove all unused volumes and free up disk space.
